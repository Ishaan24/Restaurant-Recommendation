Our application basically involves around Python, Angular.js, Node.js, Tableau and RDS(MySQL DB on cloud). to run the application, please install Node.js on your local machine. 

You can use https://nodejs.org/en/download/ to download Node.js to your local machine. After that, open Terminal(Mac) or command line(Windows), to go to the project's directory.

After that, just type "node app.js" to run the Node.js server. You might have to install a few modules before running the application, to install those modules, just type "npm install moduleName" on command line. You will have to install mysql, python-shell and express-session. I am using the python-shell module to run my python script from Node.js.

 Once the server is up and running, go to your browser and type localhost:3000 and press enter.
